Because of that, it is important to ensure the robustness of a network. With the aim of improving the security of the network, it is desirable to find out which are the most critical nodes in order to protect them from external attackers. This work tackles this problem, named the α-separator problem, from a heuristic perspective, proposing an algorithm based on the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP). In particular, a novel approach for the constructive procedure is proposed, where centrality metrics derived from social network analysis are used as a greedy criterion. Furthermore, the quality of the provided solutions is improved by means of a combination method based on Path Relinking (PR). This work explores different variants of PR, also adapting the most recent one, Exterior PR, for the problem under consideration. The combination of GRASP + PR allows the algorithm to obtain high-quality solutions within a reasonable computing time. The proposal is supported by a set of intensive computational experiments that show the quality of the proposal, comparing it with the most competitive algorithm found in the state of art.","tags":["\"critical nodes\"","\"GRASP\"","\"metaheuristic\"","\"Path Relinking\"","\"α-separator problem\""],"title":"Finding weaknesses in networks using Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure and Path Relinking","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1598803712,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1598803712,"objectID":"64b90833fc54efee772f0f839f07a9bd","permalink":"https://sergiop3rez.github.io/es/project/infseg/","publishdate":"2020-08-30T18:08:32+02:00","relpermalink":"/es/project/infseg/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Infseg","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559458800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1559458800,"objectID":"fe0d21e87bf943a2509c629829cff4a5","permalink":"https://sergiop3rez.github.io/es/talk/verolog2019/","publishdate":"2019-06-02T09:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/es/talk/verolog2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Workshop of the EURO Working Group on Vehicle Routing and Logistics optimization (VeRoLog)","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Sergio Pérez-Peló","Jesús Sánchez-Oro","Ana Dolores López-Sánchez","Abraham Duarte"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1598806678,"objectID":"873494b53994757546c6b3dbfdf4a6bb","permalink":"https://sergiop3rez.github.io/es/publication/electronics-8121440/","publishdate":"2020-08-30T16:57:58.286316Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/electronics-8121440/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper generalizes the iterated greedy algorithm to solve a multi-objective facility location problem known as the Bi-objective p-Center and p-Dispersion problem (    B p C D    ).

Networks are naturally dynamic systems to which a wide variety of devices are continuously connecting and disconnecting. This dynamic nature force us to maintain a constant analysis looking for weak points that can eventually disconnect the network. The detection of weak points is devoted to find which nodes must be reinforced in order to increase the safety of the network. This work tackles the $$ backslashalpha $$$α$separator problem, which aims to find a minimum set of nodes that disconnect the network in subnetworks of size smaller than a given threshold.

As a consequence, it is possible to detect radicalism or even reduce the size of the data to be analyzed, among other applications. This paper presents a metaheuristic approach based on Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) methodology for detecting communities in social networks. The community detection problem is modeled as an optimization problem, where the objective function to be optimized is the modularity of the network, a well-known metric in this scientific field. The results obtained outperform classical methods of community detection over a set of real-life instances with respect to the quality of the communities detected.","tags":[],"title":"On the Analysis of the Influence of the Evaluation Metric in Community Detection over Social Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538636400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1538636400,"objectID":"1a78afdcdf57ad0b8dc0cded7060fd56","permalink":"https://sergiop3rez.github.io/es/talk/vns2018/","publishdate":"2018-10-04T09:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/es/talk/vns2018/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"6th International Conference on Variable Neighborhood Search","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Sergio Pérez-Peló","Jesús Sánchez-Oro","Abraham Duarte"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1598819972,"objectID":"13444a0ac7f103381353ce0c9842202c","permalink":"https://sergiop3rez.github.io/es/publication/10-1007-978-3-030-03496-2-37/","publishdate":"2020-08-30T20:39:32.890416Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/10-1007-978-3-030-03496-2-37/","section":"publication","summary":"Most of the critical infrastructures can be easily modeled as a network of nodes interconnected among them. If one or more nodes of the network fail, the connectivity of the network can be compromised, to the point of completely disconnecting the network. Additionally, disconnecting the network can result in cascade failures, because the remaining nodes may be overloaded because of heavy traffic in the network. One of the main objectives of an attacker is to isolate the nodes whose removal disconnect the network in minimum size subnetworks. On the contrary, a defender must identify those weak points in order to maintain the network integrity. This work is focused on solving the $$ backslashalpha $$$α$separator problem, whose main objective is to find a minimum set of nodes that disconnect a network in isolated subnetworks of size smaller than a given value. The problem is tackled from a metaheuristic point of view, analyzing the solutions given by a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure over different network topologies. The results obtained are compared with the best algorithm found in the literature.","tags":[],"title":"A Metaheuristic Approach for the α-separator Problem","type":"publication"}]
